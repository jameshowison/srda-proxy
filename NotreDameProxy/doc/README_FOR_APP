This is a very simple proxy for the Notre Dame web forms, which I wrote just to have a SOAP WebService implementation that I could love.

All it does is expose a single Web Service defined in a WSDL file which, when the server is running, is available at APP_ROOT/notre_dame_sf/wsdl where APP_ROOT is wherever you have the application running.

I had troubles with the ActiveWebService plugin in Rails 2, so I've frozen Rails 1.3 something into vender/rails.

The system does need the mechanize gem installed (and its dependencies).  On any sane system this should be a sudo gem install mechanize away.

Once that's in place it's a standard Rails start up:

script/server from the NoteDameProxy home directory.
